title: "You Are Here"

<p>Welcome to my blog! I plan to write here about interesting things that I encounter, stuff I've coded, and whatever I feel like writing about.</p>

<p>Since I'm currently learning <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, expect some content regarding this cool language. I also work in Java, so that may show up here and there, too.</p>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> ({{post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d"}})
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
