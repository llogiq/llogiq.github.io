title: Out of the Box Dynamic Dispatch
---

Rust's generics give us a whole lot of flexibility. A method that takes
a trait bound argument does not need to care about the actual type of
the argument it is called with. For example:

```rust
fn parse_read(r: impl Read) -> MyParseableType {
    todo!();
}
```

However, this will monomorphize the method: For each `Read` instance,
one instance will be created, potentially ballooning up the code size
and increasing compile time. But Rust gives us dynamic dispatch, too,
e.g.

```rust
fn parse_read(r: &mut dyn Read) -> MyParseableType {
    todo!();
}
```

This makes each call on `r` *dynamic*. Only one version of this method 
needs to be created, but whenever `r`'s methods are called, the method 
must be looked up at runtime. This is done by having one `static` data 
per type that tells us where to find the respective methods. This
so-called [`vtable`] is referenced whenever we need dynamic dispatch.

[`vtable`]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table

Now let's say we want to pass our `Read` instance through to the 
method. For our example, we want to use `Stdin` or some `File`.

```rust
let readable = todo!();
parse_read(readable)
```

How should we initialize `readable`? The novice's initial attempt is
foiled by the type system:

```rust
let readable = if arg == "-" {
    io::stdin()
} else {
    fs::File::open(arg)?
};
```

The type checker is having none of it.

```text
error[E0308]: if and else have incompatible types
 --> src/main.rs:5:9
  |
2 |       let readable = if arg == "-" {
  |  _____________________-
3 | |         std::io::stdin()
  | |         ---------------- expected because of this
4 | |     } else {
5 | |         std::fs::File::open(arg)?
  | |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected struct `std::io::Stdin`, found struct `std::fs::File`
6 | |     };
  | |_____- if and else have incompatible types

error: aborting due to previous error
```

Now the novice asks around and finds that `Box`es can hold dynamic
types.

```rust
let readable = if arg == "-" {
    Box::new(io::stdin())
} else {
    Box::new(fs::File::open(arg)?)
};
```

This still doesn't work, because we haven't told the compiler to make
the type dynamic. And alas, the error message isn't quite helpful. We
can annotate the type to make it work:

```rust
let readable: Box<dyn io::Read> = if arg == "-" {
    Box::new(io::stdin())
} else {
    Box::new(fs::File::open(arg)?)
};
```

`Box` can have a little dynamic dispatch, as a trait. This will store
the `vtable` pointer along with our `Read` instance in the `Box`'s
allocated memory.

However, we are Rustaceans, so we don't want to `Box` to get dynamic 
dispatch. What we need are two places to hold our `Read` instances that 
live long enough to use them:

```rust
// these must live longer than `readable`
let (mut stdin_read, mut file_read);
let readable: &mut dyn io::Read = if arg == '-' {
    stdin_read = io::stdin();
    &mut stdin_read
} else {
    file_read = fs::File::open(arg)?;
    &mut file_read
};
```

The readable is out of the box! What happens is that we declare two 
stack slots that may alternately stay uninitialized or used, depending 
on `arg`. Then we take a `&mut dyn` mutable dynamic reference on it, 
which means the type will have a non-null pointer to the object (either 
`stdin_read` or `file_read`, depending on the branch taken) and a 
second reference to the `vtable` of either the `Stdin` type or the 
`File` type.

As an aside, this technique can also be used to create an `Option<&T>`
where we don't want to initialize the `T` unless needed:

```rust
let t_holder;
let opt_t = if has_t {
    t_holder = get_t();
    Some(&t_holder)
} else {
    None
}
```
